# Multicast DNS

A simple Multicast Domain Name Service based on [RFC 6762](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762).  
Can be used as both a client (sending queries) or a server (responding to queries).

The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/richardschneider/net-mdns) and the 
package is published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ipfs.Dns.Multicast).

The interplanetary file system is the permanent web. It is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open.
